            <h2>Scatter Plot</h2>
            <p>A scatter plot uses dots to represent values for two different numeric variables. The position of each dot on the horizontal and vertical axis indicates values for an individual data point.</p>

            <h2>Line Chart</h2>
            <p>A line chart displays information as a series of data points called 'markers' connected by straight line segments. It is used to visualize data trends over time or ordered categories.</p>

        <section id="bubble-chart">
            <h2>Bubble Chart</h2>
            <p>A bubble chart is a type of chart that displays three dimensions of data. Each entity with its triplet of associated data is plotted as a disk that expresses two of the viariables through the disk's xy location and the third through its size.</p>

        <section id="pie-chart">
            <h2>Pie Chart</h2>
            <p>A pie chart is a circular statistical graphic, which is divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportion. In a pie chart, the arc length of each slice (and consequently its central angle and area), is proportional to the quantity it represents.</p>

            <h2>Bar Chart</h2>
            <p>A bar chart or bar graph is a chart or graph that presents categorical data with rectangular bars with heights or lengths proportional to the values that they represent.</p>

            <h2>Donut Chart</h2>
            <p>A donut chart is a variant of the pie chart, with a blank center allowing for additional information about the data as a whole to be included.</p>
